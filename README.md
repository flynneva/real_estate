# real_estate
Tool to work with realtor.com/research/data CSV files.

# getting started
First, make sure you have python 3.X installed. I use Python 3.6.9 on my workstation.

Once you have python installed, go ahead and install some dependencies
```bash
pip3 install csv pandas matplotlib pick
```

Now go ahead and clone this repository somewhere
```bash
git clone https://github.com/flynneva/real_estate
```

Now download the updated data from [realtor.com/research/data](realtor.com/research/data) csv file and rename it to something short....I chose 'data.csv'.

Run the script like a normal python script:
```bash
python3 realtor-dot-com-tools.py
```

And it should prompt for user input and give descriptions on what each choice does.

Feel free to create issues/pull requests if you find any issues!

Happy House Hunting!
